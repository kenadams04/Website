SOI's mission Mars One aims to establish a permanent human settlement on Mars. Mars is the only planet we know of that can currently feasibly support human life and will be humankind’s first step to become a multiplanetary species. Before carefully selected and trained crews willdepart to Mars, several unmanned missions will be completed, establishing a habitable settlement waiting for the first astronauts to arrive. The Mars One crews will go to Mars not to simply visit, but to live, explore, and create a second home for humanity. The first men and women to go to Mars are going there to stay.
</br></br>
Funding and implementing this plan will not be easy. The challenges are great, but as Mars One moves the mission forward, hurdles will be overcome step by step, with the help of Mars One's advisers and with established aerospace companies.
</br></br>
 The Mars One Foundation implements and manages the mission and owns the mission hardware. It also selects and trains the crews, and is building an ever growing community of experts and fans that follow the progress of the mission and contribute to it. SOI holds the exclusive monetization rights around the mission, from merchandise, ads on video content, broadcasting rights, Intellectual Property, and many more.
</br></br>
SOI will pay an upfront fee to the Mars One Foundation as part of the exclusive monetization rights contract and will pay a 5% license fee on all turnover to the Foundation. The Foundation will use revenue from these sources to move the mission to Mars forward: award new contracts to suppliers, organize Round Three of the Astronaut Selection Process, and hire team members with extensive experience in Mars missions.
